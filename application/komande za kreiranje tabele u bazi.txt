These include tabby, bicolor, particolor, tabby and white, and solid. Also, every eye color is possible, though copper is the most common.','The Scottish Straight is one of the feline breeds that make up the Scottish Breed Group, along with the beloved Scottish Fold.  The very first Scottish Fold was a barn cat whose name was Susie. She was found by William Ross in 1961 in Scotland, and she was later bred with other breeds, such as the American Shorthair, Burmese, Exotic Shorthair, and Persian. Today, the Scottish Straight is known for its wonderful personality and temperament. The Scottish Straight is one of the feline breeds that make up the Scottish Breed Group, along with the beloved Scottish Fold. The Scottish Straight, like the Scottish Fold, is known for its inquisitiveness, loyalty, and intelligence. These cats are not typically shy, as they would much prefer always being around you, perhaps even following you from one room to the next throughout your home.  Despite enjoying being around people, these cats generally do not like being carried or picked up, and they do have a bit of an independent side that makes them comfortable being near you but still being able to do their own thing. Therefore, they make great pets for those who are searching for a cat that will be devoted without being too clingy to their human family.','Although Scottish Folds have a predisposition for joint disease, keeping your cat at a healthy weight can minimize the potential for future joint pain. Additionally, certain cat foods contain nutrients that promote healthy joints. Options like Pro Plan Focus Weight Management Chicken & Rice Formula or Purina ONE Healthy Metabolism will help your Fold maintain a healthy weight.','3','https://i.imgur.com/OsCoCOz.jpg','4','4','11 - 15 years','4','medium to large');

These all-American cats are medium in size, build, type, and temperament; they are neither too big nor too small, not overly cuddly nor distant, neither couch potatoes nor hyperactive. The American Shorthair is the perfect breed for those who want a cat that enjoys being in your lap but not in your face. American Shorthairs are known for their adaptable temperaments and quiet voices; they are sociable, easily trained, and adapt well to other animals and children. They generally do not like to be picked up; like their Pilgrim companions who left England to find freedom, they cherish their independence. Because of the American Shorthair s history as a working cat, they make great companions in terms of health, strength, and vitality. American Shorthairs enjoy a good romp with their favorite humans, but can amuse themselves with a ball of paper just as well. They tend to remain active and playful well into their old age. Due to their barn cat background, ASHs have strong hunting instincts and enjoy catching and killing catnip mice and real ones, too, if given access to the great outdoors, something that s discouraged by breeders. Your indoor ASH will put presents on your pillow, usually well-killed catnip mice, and proudly wait for the well-deserved petting and praise.','Because American Shorthairs are generally healthy, a complete and balanced cat food should be sufficient for their needs. If your American puts on weight due to inactivity, however, you may want to consider a healthy weight formula like Purina Pro Plan Focus Adult Weight Management Formula or Purina ONE Healthy Metabolism, and if she regularly develops hairballs, consider a specially formulated cat food to help control them, such as Purina Pro Plan Focus Hairball Management Chicken & Rice Formula.','4','https://image.freepik.com/free-photo/american-shorthair-cat_212190-10.jpg','4','3','15 - 20 years','4','medium to large');

When they re with their own beloved and trusted humans, however, they are playful and affectionate. Russian Blues are active but not overly so. They like nothing better than to spend time pouncing on a favorite toy or chasing sunbeams. They willingly entertain themselves, but prefer games in which their preferred people take an active role. When you re home, they follow you around, unobtrusive but ever-present companions.  The slight upturn to the corners of the mouth make Russian Blues appear to be forever smiling. Members of this breed are generally polite, quiet, and well-behaved, for cats. It s quite easy to teach them to stay off counters and out of off-limit areas; usually a simple    No    will do. However, Russian Blues seem to think politeness should go both ways and take offense at being made to look silly. A dignified cat, Russian Blues can be trusted to know when you re making fun of them and they won t soon forget this breach in manners, either.  Russian Blues like their daily routine to be just so, and dislike household changes more than the average cat  and the average cat dislikes household changes a lot. They particularly dislike changes to their dinner schedule, and will make you aware of their displeasure. They are also fastidious about their litter boxes and will complain or may even go elsewhere if they re not spic and span.','Although they re a relatively healthy breed, Russian Blue Cats are at risk of obesity due to their love of food. In addition to providing them with plenty of exercise through play time, consider selecting a weight-management formula for your kitty s food. A cat food like Purina ONE Healthy Metabolism or Pro Plan Focus Weight Management Chicken & Rice Formula will help your Russian Blue maintain a healthy weight throughout her life.','3','https://homelivingpets.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screenshot_7.png','4','4','10-20 years','3','medium');

These cute, curious cats are known for snatching shiny objects, so don t be surprised if these    magpies    borrow your favorite piece of jewelry. For their part, Munchkins, oblivious to the controversy surrounding them, go on being just what they are cats self-assured and outgoing. Shortchanged in the leg department doesn t mean short on intelligence or personality. Friendly and people-oriented, Munchkins make devoted companions, and they get along well with other cats, dogs, and people. They love to wrestle and play with their long-legged feline friends, happily unaware that there s anything different about them. Nor do their feline companions treat them as members of the vertically challenged. It s only humans who look at them askance.  Fanciers assert Munchkins can do anything an ordinary cat can do, except leap to the top of the kitchen counter. Some fanciers consider this a feature, however, instead of a disadvantage. Despite the short legs, Munchkins run fast, bounding like ferrets and taking corners at full speed. To get a better view, they often sit up on their haunches rather like prairie dogs. They can climb cat posts and curtains as well as any cat. However, they can t jump as high because the shorter back legs don t provide as much leverage. Munchkins can jump onto most beds, chairs, and couches, but may take a scenic route onto a chair or other lower item before attempting your desk.  Munchkins are also known as magpies, often borrowing small, shiny objects and stashing them away for later play. Proficient hunters, Munchkins love a good game of catnip mouse, but when playtime is over, they want a warm lap to snuggle into and strokes from a loving hand, like any cat.','Munchkins need a complete and balanced diet, coupled with regular exercise, to maintain a healthy weight and avoid unnecessary stress on their joints. An adult cat food such as Purina Cat Chow Indoor, Purina Cat Chow Naturals Indoor or Purina Beyond Indoor Grain Free Salmon & Egg Recipe can help keep your Munchkin happy and healthy. Because of their short legs, your Munchkin kitty may need a shallower bowl than other breeds. If you have questions or concerns about your cat s nutrition, consult with your veterinarian.','4','https://i.pinimg.com/originals/58/cf/4d/58cf4d615803676cd4507e33d80d29e7.gif','1','4','12 - 15 years','4','small');

The breed has been established by crosses to British Shorthair and domestic cats in Scotland and England. In America, the outcross is the American and British Shorthair. All bona fide Scottish Fold cats trace their pedigree to Susie.  Scottish Folds are typically intelligent, sweet-tempered, soft-spoken, and easily adaptable to new people and situations. They are loyal and tend to bond with one person in the household. While they will usually allow others to cuddle and pet them, their primary attachment becomes quickly clear as they single out their chosen human. They thrive on attention, but it must be on their own terms. Despite their devotion, they are not clingy, demanding cats and usually prefer to be near you rather than on your lap. They enjoy a good game of catch the catnip mouse now and then as well, and keep their playful side well into adulthood.  Despite being folded, the Fold s ears are still expressive and swivel to listen, lay back in anger, and prick up when a can of food is opened. The fold in the ear can become less pronounced when the cat is upset or ill. Although some Fold family members report an increased production of wax buildup in their cats  ears, the folded ears typically do not make the cat more susceptible to mites or ear infections. The previously reported susceptibility to deafness may be related to the fact that some early Scottish Folds were white, and white cats can be prone to a type of deafness that s unrelated to the Fold gene.','Although Scottish Folds have a predisposition for joint disease, keeping your cat at a healthy weight can minimize the potential for future joint pain. Additionally, certain cat foods contain nutrients that promote healthy joints. Options like Pro Plan Focus Weight Management Chicken & Rice Formula or Purina ONE Healthy Metabolism will help your Fold maintain a healthy weight.','3','https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/DKzwsUgN3TbHEW5CgHgNocx9eigFEunSXi-WA870ubEQvCcISXWXyxsDTPYdbnwG5OQA-X-7I9nq4EzUD77Q8YbPuqeCqSJd1aO1lRfcqiPwS5NHOlu51UzJm1Cb1EDEg0NXozb9LMNb3RXo3Re0NVTYLXZetA4iwuTUumJAyEY0GyVJi733aYVEvsovm3kS','4','4','11 - 15 years','4','medium to large');

They show affection to their people by greeting them, following them around, sitting in their laps and snuggling in bed. Ragdoll cats can also learn tricks and certain behaviors with positive reinforcement. The Ragdoll is a well-balanced cat with no extreme features. They are a medium to large, moderately longhaired, blue-eyed pointed cats. The point markings may be covered by a range of white overlay patterns. Ragdolls are slow maturing, reaching full coat and color at about three years of age. The Ragdoll is an affectionate and intelligent cat, giving the impression of graceful movement and subdued power, striking in appearance. Docile, mild-mannered, and congenial, Ragdolls make ideal indoor companions. One of the nicest features of these cats is their laid-back, sweet personality. They are devotion wrapped in silky fur, loving loyalty with gentle white paws. Very in tune with their human s routines and emotions, Ragdolls are there when you come home at night to greet you with a leg rub, a forehead kiss, and a big purr. If you ve had a bad day, they ll cuddle into your lap to offer gentle comfort so that soon you ll be smiling again. A better friend you couldn t have.  They are playful but are not overactive. Known to adapt easily to almost any environment, Ragdolls get along well with children and adults, as well as other cats and dogs. They are easily trained to stay off the counter and are affectionate without being overly demanding. They have soft, polite voices, even at dinnertime, even though they are renowned for their enthusiasm for food. One thing Ragdolls are not, however, is impervious to pain. If you accidentally step on their tails, they ll shriek and eye you reproachfully, just as any other cat will.','Because of their large size, Ragdoll owners must provide their cats with a complete and balanced diet and plenty of playful exercise to maintain a healthy weight. Dry cat food options like Purina Cat Chow Indoor, Purina ONE Healthy Metabolism, Purina ONE Indoor Advantage or Pro Plan Focus Weight Management Chicken & Rice Formula can aid in weight management to keep your Ragdoll kitty happy and healthy.

This cat has large round eyes set wide apart in a large round head. The long thick coat softens the lines of the cat and accentuates the roundness in appearance. If you want your cats bouncing around like hyperactive popcorn, don t adopt a Persian. Persians are perfect companions, if you like placid, sweet-tempered cats. Don t count on using your Persian pal as a furry doorstop, however. They love to play between periods of regal lounging on your favorite davenport. Proponents say that Persians do not deserve their furniture-with-fur reputation; they are intelligent, just not as inquisitive as some breeds, and not as active.  Persians are devoted to their humans, but can be selective in conferring that honor. You must earn their trust and love. They crave affection and love to be petted and fussed over, but won t harass you for attention the way some breeds will. They will, however, let their feelings be known if they are not getting the requisite amount of attention.  Persians require significant time commitment. That beautiful coat requires daily grooming to keep it in good condition and free of mats. Many Persians require professional grooming.','The flat face and short jaw of your Persian kitty may make it more difficult for her to eat dry kibble and drink enough water. Consider giving her a dry cat food like Purina ONE Hairball Formula or Pro Plan Focus Hairball Management Chicken & Rice Formula and supplementing with a wet cat food such as Pro Plan Focus Indoor Salmon & Rice Formula.    This will help ensure your Persian is getting all the nutrients she needs, while helping control hairballs caused by her long and luscious coat.

A distinctive characteristic of this cat is the smooth, shaggy coat. This breed is well-proportioned, has a balanced appearance, and has adapted to varied environments. No breed has a monopoly on love and affection, but there is got to be some good reason that Maine Coons have clawed their way up from near extinction to the prized place of America is second most popular breed. Maine Coons are kittens in big cat suits, gentle giants who are playful well into old age, as well as jumbo-sized packages of loving devotion. Maine Coons can also be reserved around people with whom they are not familiar, probably due to their jumbo-sized brains. Given time, however, even the most cautious adapt. This initial adjustment period is actually a decision-making process; Maine Coons are deciding if these new humans have proven themselves worthy of trust. As soon as they make up their minds, however, they form close bonds with the entire household and become loving and devoted.  Most want to be near you but not on your lap. They are true family members and participate in all family routines, whether watching you channel surf from the comfort of the couch, or following you from room to room. As befits a former seafarer, Maine Coons are fascinated by water, perhaps because their thick coats are water-repellent and won t become annoyingly soaked as easily as a thinner coat would. Some will join their humans in the shower briefly, or at least walk around on the wet floor after you get out. They prefer to stand on the edge of the tub, however, and touch the water with a curious paw.','Pro Plan cat food offers several excellent options for feeding an adult Maine Coon Cat.
